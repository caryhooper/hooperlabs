    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="text">
        Wing FTP Server is an easy-to-use, secure, and reliable FTP server software for Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and Solaris. It supports multiple file transfer protocols, including FTP, FTPS, HTTP, HTTPS, and SFTP, giving your clients flexibility in how they connect to the server. And it provides admins with a web-based interface to administrate the server from anywhere. You can also monitor server performance and online sessions and even receive email notifications about various events taking place on the server. </p>

        <h4>Vulnerability - CVE-2020-XXXX</h4>
        <p class="text">
            A number of weaknesses in Wing FTP Server allows any local user to escalate privileges to root on Linux, MacOS, and Solaris.  Three weaknesses were discovered in the software which make exploitation possible.  They are:
        </p>
    <h5>Issues:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Wing FTP Server incorrectly interprets the permissions of symbolic links.</li>
        <li>Wing FTP Server sets an unsafe umask (permissions) for all files modified within the web interface.</li>
        <li>By default, the server sets unsafe permissions on system files, compromising the integrity of system settings and user password hashes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p class="text">
        To install the server, download from the Wing FTP website and extract the archive.  Within the directory, run the wftpserver binary.  During installation, the software prompts the user to create an administrative user, an administrative password, choose which port the administrative HTTP interface should use (default 5466), then asks whether Wing FTP Server should start.  The installation directory hereon will be referred to as <b>$WINGFTP_DIR</b>.  
    <p class="text">
        Ports will not open until the server is further configured.  Once a domain is created within the admin interface (http://localhost:5466), Wing FTP server listens by default on TCP ports 21 (FTP), 990 (FTPS), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH).  Alternatively, the server will also open these services once a "domain" folder is created within <b>$WINGFTP_DIR</b> with a valid portlistener.xml file inside.
     </p>
    <p class="text">
        For the following attack scenarios, consider a Wing FTP Server installation on a Linux (Ubuntu 18.0) host.  A low-privilege Linux user (lowleveluser) with terminal access also has a Wing FTP account and access to their home directory (/home/lowleveluser).   After examining a few attack scenarios, it will become clear that the only prerequisite for escalation of privilege is command execution on the server as <i>any user</i>. 
    </p>
    <h3>Attack Scenario: Issue 1</h3>    
    <h4>Unsafe interpretation of symbolic links</h4>
    <p class="text">
    Wing FTP server does not appear to check permissions while conducting file operations.  In addition, the software follows symbolic links by default.  If a user creates a symbolic link to the filesystem root (ln -s / filesystem), a low-privilege user with read-only permissions in Wing FTP may gain privileges to read the entire filesystem, including sensitive system files only readable by root.  This is because Wing FTP Server (without some serious re-configuration/work) must be run as a superuser.  Any Wing FTP user utilizing the HTTP interface may access any file in their path with permissions of the root user.  If the user has read, write, and delete privileges, they also gain privileges to write or delete any file on the filesystem.  
    </p>
    <h4>Exploitation</h4>
    <p class="text">
       Any user may create a symbolic link within a folder for which they have write privileges.  
        <img src="../img/wftpflow1a.PNG" />
       This grants them read or read/write access to the entire filesystem.  
        <img src="../img/wftpflow1b.PNG" />
        This user may read sensitive files such as the /etc/shadow file, crack passwords offline, and gain privileges as the root user.  If the user has read, write, and delete privileges, they may also write to system files to increase privileges directly (by editing /etc/sudoers or /etc/shadow directly).  
        <img src="../img/wftpflow1c.PNG" />
    </p>
    <h3>Attack Scenario: Issue 2</h3>
    <h4>Unsafe permissions set when modifying files</h4>
    <p class="text">
        Wing FTP Server appears to utilize the umask=111 when modifying files.  The umask is able to be set in the administrator interface (http://localhost:5466).  
        In fact, by default, the default permissions to be set on edited or created files is "644".  Though this is the case via FTP, files edited or created via the HTTP(S) interface are saved as world-readable and world-writable files ("666").  
        This appears to be a bug in Wing FTP Server.  Thus, if any Wing FTP user modifies a file on the filesystem, the owner and group will be changed to root and the permissions will be changed to "666".
        In addition, the permissions of the file will be changed to 666 (world readable and world writable).  This means that any modifications to sensitive files result in full read/write privileges being granted to all users on the system.
        If this occurs, this increases the privileges all non-superusers have for these files.  The modification of a particularly sensitive file (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/sudoers, etc.) create a escalation of privilege vulnerability on the system. 
    </p>
    <h4>Exploitation</h4>
    <p class="text">
        The screenshot below shows a user accessing a sensitive file via the Wing FTP Server HTTP(S) interface, then clicking the “Save” button to perform a file modify operation.  
        <img src="/img/wftpflow2a.PNG" />
       With command line access, we may see that the permissions of /etc/shadow was changed to 666 (world-writable). 
        <img src="/img/wftpflow2b.PNG" />
    </p>
    <h3>Attack Scenario: Issue 3</h3>
    <h4>Unsafe default permissions on sensitive Wing FTP configuration files</h4>
    <p class="text">
       Once a domain is created and user accounts are added via the administrative interface (http://localhost:5466), they are saved to <b>$WINGFTP_DIR</b>/Data/&lt;domain&gt;/users/&lt;username&gt;.xml, where &lt;domain&gt; and &lt;username&gt; are the names of the domain and users, respectively.
       The files "&lt;username&gt;.xml" are created such they are world-readable, allowing any user on the system to view existing users and the md5 hash of their passwords.  
       In addition, these user files are <i>world-writable</i>, allowing any user to forge Wing FTP user information to increase privileges within the application, change their permission path, or change other user’s passwords.  
       To make mattesr worse, the folder <b>$WINGFTP_DIR</b>&lt;domain&gt;/users, by default, is created with full global permissions (777).  
       This allows any user on the system to write to it.  Combined, these insecure permissions allow any user to forge entire Wing FTP user accounts.
    </p>
    <h4>Exploitation</h4>
    <p class="text">
        First, an administrative user may log into the administrative interface (http://localhost:5466) to view the existing user accounts.  This is to show the existing users within the system for a given domain.
        In this example, two user accounts exist: "adminuser" and "lowleveluser".  
        <img src="/img/wftpflow3a.PNG" />
        Using a crafted XML file similar to those in &lt;username&gt;.xml files created by Wing FTP Server, an attacker may forge a user by copying the XML file into the users directory located at <b>$WINGFTP_DIR</b>/Data/&lt;domain&gt;/users/ (see screenshot below).  
        In this case, we're adding a user "h00p" with a password of "h00p" with full permissions in the filesystem root ("/").
        <img src="/img/wftpflow3b.PNG" />
        Again within the administrative interface, an administrative user may refresh the page to observe a new user "h00p" created within the application.
        <img src="/img/wftpflow3c.PNG" />
        Last, the forged user "h00p" may successfully log in to the application.  Observe in the HTTPS response that the "Set-Cookie" HTTP header is returned with a valid "UID" cookie granting access to the application.  
        <img src="/img/wftpflow3d.PNG" />
        In this way, a user with terminal access or command execution on the server may forge a user account. 
    </p>
    
    <h4>Putting it Together:</h4>
    <p class="text">
        At this point, the path to privilege escalation should be pretty clear.  But just for clarity, I've included the steps below.
    </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Have terminal access or code execution on the server as any user.</li>
            <li>Forge a user account with (at a minimum) read, write, and delete privileges.</li>
            <li>Within the HTTP(S) interface, modify a sensitive system file.  This will make the file world-writable.</li>
            <li>Modify the sensitive system file to make it world-writable.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Exploit</h4>
    <p class="text">
        To facilitate exploitation, I've created an exploit for this bug, provided a user has SSH access already to the system.  
        The exploit, written with Python's paramiko, will log in, forge a Wing FTP user account, log in via the HTTP(S) interface, and modify the sudoers file to give the current user root privilegs.
        Obviously each of these steps can be done manually as well.  Enjoy!
