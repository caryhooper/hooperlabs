    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p class="text">
        The Hero Maps Premium plugin for WordPress was prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it did not sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.  An attacker may leverage this issue
        to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site.  This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or launch other attacks.

        <h4>Vulnerability - CVE-2019-19134</h4>
        <p class="text">
            Multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities were identified in publicly-exposed endpoints of WordPress sites loaded with the Hero Maps Premium plugin.  In each case, the application accepted input within
            HTTP parameters, which were later returned within the page.  Multiple pages and multiple parameters were susceptible to this attack. 
        </p>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Locate a WordPress instance with Hero Maps Premium (v.2.2.1 or prior) installed.  (hxxp://wordpress.example.com).</li>
            <li>Within a browser, navigate to the following URL: hxxp://wordpress.example.com/wp-content/plugins/hmapsprem/views/dashboard/index.php?p=/wp-content/plugins/hmapsprem/foo%22%3E%3Csvg//onload=%22alert(%27XSS%20in%20Hero%20Maps%20Premium%202.1.6%27)%22%3E</li>
            <li>Observe that the "p" parameter from the URL was passed directly into the page without sanitization - "&gt;&lt;svg//onload="alert('XSS in Hero Maps Premium'). 
            Observe that the SVG element is interpreted as a HTML element and that the associated JavaScript event handler executes within the context of the victimâ€™s browser.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Testing Conditions:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Firefox v70.0.1</li>
            <li>WordPress 5.2.1</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
            The Hero Maps developer's professionalism and willingness to fix the issues were second to none.  Upon notification, they worked to fully resolve the XSS issues to protect Hero Maps users.
