    <h3>
        Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
    </h3>
    <p class=text>
        Hooper Labs takes security issues seriously.  We believe in working with relevant stakeholders to achieve coordinated disclosure within a reasonable period of time.
        We also adhere to the industry-standard 90-day disclosure deadline, where vendors are notified of vulnerabilities immediately with details shared with in public after
        90 days or sooner if the issues are resolved earlier.
    </p>
    <p class=text>
        Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) are an industry standard for identifying vulnerabilities <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">
        (link)</a>.  This system is a method for reference and tracking of publicly-known exposures.  We believe that users have a right to know they are exposed in order to 
        fully communicate the importance of patching their systems.  MITRE Corporation is the primary CVE Numbering Authority for this program.  A CVE is a way to uniquely reference 
        vulnerabilities across systems.
    </p>
     <p class=text>
        Hooper Labs does not participate in bug bounty programs, but instead relies on responsible disclosure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure">(link)</a>.
        Effectively communicating vulnerabilities and risks to the vendor, users, and public ensure that risk can be documented, calculated, and mitigated.  We hope that through this 
        process that the Information Domain may be marginally safer.
